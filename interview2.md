###########BI/Analytics ##########

Having looked at a lot of these things, here's the criteria I use to evaluate these kinds of services -
1/ How easy is it to get data in?
2/ Is my data safe?
3/ How easy is authoring?
4/ Does it support pivots?
5/ Can I model joins?
6/ Does it support dashboard-wide filters?
7/ Does it support complex time comparisons?
